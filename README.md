📈 My Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Showcase  
Welcome to my repository of data analysis projects. In this space, I dive deep into diverse datasets to uncover underlying patterns, test hypotheses, and extract meaningful insights using a variety of visual methods.  

💳 Project 1: Credit Card Industry EDA  
This project's goal is doing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the Credit Card Industry to help the company with proactive offers and services to the customers, gain market share and minimize customer churn. The goal is to analyze the data set to summarize its main characteristics using several different visual methods, primarily for seeing what the data can tell us.  

🚗 Project 2: Traffic Data Analysis  
Summary  
This notebook analyzes traffic data to find patterns in vehicle counts by time and location. It uses visualizations to show peak hours, busiest junctions, and monthly trends, and suggests ways to improve traffic flow.  

Problem Statement  
Objective: To analyze traffic patterns using the given dataset and develop data-driven optimization strategies that reduce congestion, improve mobility,  
and enhance urban traffic management—particularly focusing on high-density areas like Junction 1.  

Context: The dataset contains timestamped vehicle counts across multiple junctions, offering a granular view of traffic flow. Junction 1 consistently experiences high vehicle density, leading to delays, pollution, and commuter dissatisfaction.  

Challenges:  
Uneven traffic distribution across junctions  
Peak-hour congestion with limited infrastructure  
Inefficient signal timing and lack of adaptive control  
Overreliance on private vehicles due to suboptimal public transport  

Goals:  
Identify traffic trends and peak congestion periods  
Quantify vehicle load per junction and time window  
Evaluate the impact of rerouting and signal optimization  
Simulate adaptive traffic control using predictive modeling  
Recommend infrastructure and policy changes based on data insights  

💻 Technologies I Used  
For these analyses, I relied on the core Python data science stack:  

Pandas  
NumPy 
Matplotlib & Seaborn  
Scikit-learn
