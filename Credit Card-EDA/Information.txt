The dataset brings information about 100 customers.

Silver clients:   
They represent 21% of our customers, are in average 49 Years Old, have an average of 167k Limit and their Spend Amount grew 7% from 2004 to 2006, from 27.389M to 29.324M. The average spends per client in 2006 is 0.978M.  
The Payment Amount in 2006 is 27.923M, meaning it represents 95% of Spend Amount, what could be a yellow light in terms of default, so we should review their Limits. Their main jobs are in Government (26%) and in Multinational Corporations (24%), meaning there´s some job and salary stability to them. Their main spends are in Transportation Tickets (27%), Petro (14%) and Camera (13%), indicating it´s probably a niche with high interest in leisure trips.  
The strategy advice for this niche is keeping it as a stable base of clients, but with a potential to grow, offering them trip related products.

Gold clients:  
They represent 41% of our customers, are in average 47 Years Old, have an average of 500k Limit and their Spend Amount grew 33% from 2004 to 2006, from 39.424M to 52.287M. The average spends per client in 2006 is 1.376M.  
The Payment Amount in 2006 is 58.515M, meaning it represents 112% of Spend Amount, what probably means they´re good payers, so we should consider increasing their Limits. Their main jobs are as Self Employed (24%) and Normal Job (24%), making it the group that can oscillate most in terms of job and salary stability, what´s also a point to consider when increasing their Limits. Their main spends are in Transportation Tickets (28%), Petro (14%) and Camera (12%). It´s also probably a niche with high interest in leisure trips, so we could increase advertisements related to it.  
This group is the one that will probably most grow in spends in times of economic growth and will most decrease in times of economic depression, but it´s currently growing fast, so the company should take the opportunity to bring this type of customers from the market and gain market share.

Platinum clients:  
They represent 38% of our customers, are in average 43 Years Old, have an average of 140k Limit and their Spend Amount grew 33% from 2004 to 2006, from 37.679M to 50.044M. The average spends per client in 2006 is 1.564M.  
The Payment Amount in 2006 is 54.410M, meaning it represents 109% of Spend Amount, what probably means they´re good payers as well, so we should consider increasing their Limits, but not so much as for the Gold clients. Their main jobs are Normal Salary (41%), followed by Government and Salaried Pvt, both with 17% each, indicating it´s a group that can oscillate a bit in terms of job stability and salary. Their main spend are Transportation Tickets (21%), Petro (13%) and Food (12%). This niche represents the one with the highest spends per client, plus they have some salary stability and are good payers, so they really need to be treated with special attention as premium clients.  
The company strategy here needs to be in retaining them, investing in relationship, offering products they want and maybe increasing their Limits.
